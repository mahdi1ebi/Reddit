##What is Reddit:
Redditis a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The website is organized into "subreddits", communities within the Reddit community to discuss certain topics or to look at specific content. The posted links can be voted on, and the links with most votes are displayed on the front page of the website. Reddit was founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, and is also available in other languages. People in the Reddit community call themselves "redditors".[8] Subreddits are directed towards all sort of things, like education, being funny, cute pictures of animals, internet memes, and more.
